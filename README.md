# SenticNet-Sentiment-Analysis

This repository contains an application for performing basic sentiment analysis using the SenticNet sentiment lexicon. 

The code implements a bespoke sentiment analysis system developed as part of my MSc. Thesis. The research investigated unsupervised sentence-level sentiment classification using the SenticNet sentiment lexicon (http://sentic.net/). The system was developed in Pytho 2.7. 

Refactoring the code to make it more pythonic is on my TODO list. 

The Thesis has been published here: http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319389707.
