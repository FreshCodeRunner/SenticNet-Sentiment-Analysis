# SenticNet-Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains an application for performing basic sentiment analysis using the SenticNet sentiment lexicon. 
Developed in Python 2.7

This code is part of a Master Thesis @ Dublin Institute of Technology.
The research investigated unsupervised sentence-level sentiment classification using SenticNet as the source of sentiment information.
The research experiment used a bespoke sentiment analysis system developed by the author. 
The present Github repository contains the Python code of the sentiment analysis system. Refactoring the code to make it more pythonic is on my TODO list.
